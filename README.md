## Items

**Graffiti Spray Can**

![](./docpics/recipe_spray_can.png)

Press and hold the dig button (usually the left mouse button) to paint. After some time, the spray can will be empty. You can smelt spray cans, empty or not, to get the two steel ingots back. Of course, you can replace the cyan dye in the recipe with any dye you like.

If you are playing on Android: For the best spraying experience, enable `Settings` → `All Settings` → `touch_use_crosshair`.

**RGB Graffiti Spray Can**

A spray can that can paint in any 24-bit RGB color and thus in all colors supported by Minetest. Press the place button (usually the right mouse button) to change the selected color.

**Red Mushroom Extract**

**Graffiti Remover Spray Can**

A spray can that removes graffiti. Essentially an eraser.

If you want to remove a lot of graffiti at once, you can simply dig the affected nodes and place them again. This will remove all graffiti that is on them.
